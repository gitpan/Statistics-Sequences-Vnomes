        Corrected calculation of psisq for uncircularized sequences, with test of it in ref.t from Tart
        Added variance(), stdev(), nnomes() and prob_r() methods.
        More verbosity in dump() with format => 'table'
        Clean up redundant code for expected() and psisq()
        Ensure tails => 1 by default whenever getting p_value(). Could make more intelligent later on.
